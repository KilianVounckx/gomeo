# GOMEO

A small programming language written in go.

It is based on the youtube series by [CodePulse](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodePulse/featured),
[Make YOUR OWN Programming Language in Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD).

Obviously *gomeo* is not written in python, but in go. This made it a fun challenge to do.

*gomeo* is very buggy, and not at all well tested, so use on your own risk.

For the curious people, the name comes from *go*, obviously, and my other favorite programming
language at the moment, *julia*. Apart from the name and some keywords like 'elseif' and 'end',
*gomeo* has nothing to do with *julia*.
