# GOMEO

A small programming language written in go.

It is based on the youtube series by [CodePulse](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodePulse/featured),
[Make YOUR OWN Programming Language in Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD).

Obviously *gomeo* is not written in python, but in go. This made it a fun challenge to do. Unless
I somehow get a lot of feedback on this, I will not continue this project.

*gomeo* is very buggy, and not at all well tested, so use on your own risk.

To use *gomeo*, download the executable and run it from a command line. You can use a vary basic
repl. To exit the repl type exit(). Exit is a builtin function which exits the repl. The grammar
is included in this repo, so from there you can guess what it can, and probably more accurate can't
do.

There is a file **test.gm**, which holds a file which can be ran by entering the shell and typing
run("test.gm"). The extension *.gm* is not official, but is what I would use if this programming
language grew larger.

For the curious people, the name comes from *go*, obviously, and my other favorite programming
language at the moment, *julia*. Apart from the name and some keywords like 'elseif' and 'end',
*gomeo* has nothing to do with *julia*.
